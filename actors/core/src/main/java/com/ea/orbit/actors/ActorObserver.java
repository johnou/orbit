/**
 * Used to create interfaces to client objects that can be passed as remote references to actors.
 * <p>
 * Observers will receive remote messages like actors do.
 * However, since they are managed by the application they are tied to the lifecycle
 * of the cluster node or client where they exist.</p>
 * <p>
 * When a client calls an actor method passing a observer reference.
 * The framework will create a special remote reference to that observer that will be callable
 * from any actor in the cluster.
 * </p>
 * <p>The framework refers to the observers using weak references. So it's the applications
 * job to hold a hard reference to the observers.
 * Otherwise they will be garbage collected and future messages to them will start failing</p>
 * <p>
 * The actor are allowed to hold and persist references to these client objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since the observers are not indestructible, it is to be expected that references to ActorObservers may become invalid.
 * The ping() method exists to allow application code to validate if the observer is still alive.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * References to observers should be managed using ObserverManager.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * <pre>
 *  public interface ChatMember extends ActorObserver
 *  {
 *      {@literal@}OneWay
 *      Task&lt;Void&gt; receiveChatMessage(String message);
 *  }
 *
 *  public void Chat extends OrbitActor implements IChat
 *  {
 *     private ObserverManager observers;
 *
 *     public Task&lt;Void&gt; addListener(IChatMember member)
 *     {
 *          observers.addMember(observer);
 *          return Task.done();
 *     }
 *
 *     public Task&lt;Void&gt; say(String message)
 *     {
 *          observers.notifyAll( o -> o.receiveChatMessage(message) );
 *          return Task.done();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * IChatMember member1 = new IChatMember() {
 *     public Task&lt;Void&gt; receiveChatMessage(String message) {
 *          System.out.println(message);
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * IChat chat = ChatFactory.createReference("dragon-age");
 * chat.addMember(member1).join();
 * chat.say("Hello!").join();
 * </pre>
 * </p>
